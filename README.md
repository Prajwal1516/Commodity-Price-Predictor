# Commodity Price Predictor
A machine learning-based project for predicting commodity prices using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and Moving Average models. The prediction considers various factors like seasonality, weather conditions, transportation, and market trends to provide an accurate price forecast.

# **Dataset**
The dataset used contains 263 rows representing commodity price data for beans. The data captures key aspects influencing commodity prices over time.
# **Features Considered**
* Seasonality and trends
* Weather conditions
* Consumer preferences
* Transportation and supply chain efficiency
* Market trends and demand spikes

# **Project Structure**
The project includes:
* commodity_price_predictor.ipynb: Core notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation for the LSTM model.
* Main.ipynb: Web interface implementation using Flask for interactive predictions.
* Dataset folder: Includes the cleaned data for commodity price predictions.
