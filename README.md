# Commodity Price Predictor
A machine learning-based project for predicting commodity prices using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and Moving Average models. The prediction considers various factors like seasonality, weather conditions, transportation, and market trends to provide an accurate price forecast.

# **Dataset**
The dataset used contains 263 rows representing commodity price data for beans. The data captures key aspects influencing commodity prices over time.
# **Features Considered**
* Seasonality and trends
* Weather conditions
* Consumer preferences
* Transportation and supply chain efficiency
* Market trends and demand spikes

# **Project Structure**
The project includes:
* commodity_price_predictor.ipynb: Core notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation for the LSTM model.
* Main.ipynb: Web interface implementation using Flask for interactive predictions.
* Dataset folder: Includes the cleaned data for commodity price predictions.
  
# **Requirements**
To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
* Python 3.x
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn
* TensorFlow/Keras
* Flask
* Seaborn

# **Model Development**
Moving Average Model
* The moving average technique smooths out fluctuations in time-series data by calculating the average of different subsets.

LSTM Model
* LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network capable of learning long-term dependencies, particularly useful for time-series data.

Model Evaluation Metrics:
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Web Interface
The project includes a web application developed using Flask.
Features
* Input commodity details and predict prices for the next three days.
* Visual representation of historical and predicted prices.
